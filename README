This API is written in JavaScript. Here are some useful information
about installing dependencies, running and testing API.

****Dependencies required to run the API****
a) install node and npm

Problem 1
Create an API which allows applications to find breweries by state or by
type.

How to run problem 1:
npm install
npm start

I have implemented two endpoints in this API to find the breweries by state or by type.
You can run the API and go to browser or other tools like Postman to test the endpoints.
For simplicity I keep the endpoints same as Open Brewery DB. Here are the endpoints:
a) http://localhost:3000/api.openbrewerydb.org/breweries
b) http://localhost:3000/api.openbrewerydb.org/breweries?by_state=new%20mexico
c) http://localhost:3000/api.openbrewerydb.org/breweries?by_type=micro
d) http://localhost:3000/api.openbrewerydb.org/breweries?by_type=micro&by_state=new_york

I only have implemented two endpoints, but it will be fairly simple process to cover other
endpoints as well.

Assumptions made during solving the problem:

I am using JSON files that acts like a real database here. I didn't create an in memory database to
keep things simple. I also dropped the idea of creating cloud database since main focus is to
demonstrate the thought process.

Problem 2
Using the data model provided by Open Brewery DB, write a mock SQL
query finding all microbreweries in Canada. You can assume that brewery
data is stored in a table called “breweries”.

***Please don't run thing file***

Since I have assumed that the database already exist and a stable connection is established, I
only wrote a mock SQL query. Please see file called sql.js to see the implementation part.
